# CPNS Lab (Computational Psychiatry & Neuropharmacological Systems) · University of Exeter

Mechanistic modelling for mind, brain, and intelligent systems.

We study **predictive coding**, **neural dynamics**, and **active inference** in computational psychiatry and neuroscience combining experimental/clinical studies with computational modelling to understand psychiatric disorders and build intelligent agents.

## What’s in this GitHub

This GitHub hosts two kinds of things:

### 1) Tools / libraries (actively developed)
Core modelling and inference toolkits (MATLAB / Julia) used across projects.

### 2) Lab Paper branches
For many papers/preprints, we create a **dedicated branch** containing the manuscript and exact code used to generate the main results/figures.
