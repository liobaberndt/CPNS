# CPNS Lab (Computational Psychiatry & Neuropharmacological Systems) · University of Exeter

Mechanistic modelling for mind, brain, and intelligent systems.

We study **predictive coding**, **neural dynamics**, and **active inference** in computational psychiatry and neuroscience combining experimental/clinical studies with computational modelling to understand psychiatric disorders and build intelligent agents.

## What’s in this GitHub

This GitHub hosts two kinds of things:

### 1) Tools / libraries (actively developed) - branch: tools
Core modelling and inference toolkits used across projects.

- atcm: thalamo-cortical neural mass modelling tools for M/EEG (ATCM; MATLAB).
- aLogLikeFit: model fitting + Bayesian/variational inference utilities (incl. group-level/PEB-style workflows; MATLAB).
- VariationalLaplace: Julia toolbox for variational Bayesian inference (Variational Laplace) for nonlinear dynamical systems.

### 2) Lab Paper branches
For many papers/preprints, we create a **dedicated branch** containing the manuscript and code.
